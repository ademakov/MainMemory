<a id="mainmemory" class="anchor" href="#mainmemory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MainMemory</h1>

<p>The MainMemory project is intended to provide</p>

<ul>
<li>a framework for network servers of all sorts;</li>
<li>some specific implementations of such servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the MainMemory project is akin to SGI's State Threads
Library (<a href="http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/">http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/</a>). But MainMemory also
aims to take full advantage of modern multi-core systems with large
RAM sizes.</p>

<p>As the first application and testbed for the MainMemory framework
the project provides almost complete implementation of the memcached
protocol.</p>

<p>In the future it could also be used to implement any other protocol,
for instance, redis. Or something completely different like HTTP,
WebDAV, WebSocket protocols thus allowing to implement a caching HTTP
server, proxy, storage platform, or a pub-sub system.</p>

<h1>
<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h1>

<p>The project has been slowly brewing as a personal research vehicle for
some time already. A number of different approaches has been tried and
abandoned. All this time it was run mostly against memslap and memtier
benchmarks.</p>

<p>Now it has matured enough to consider it ready for experimental use by a
wide audience. Hopefully in a short term it could be declared production
ready as well.</p>

<h1>
<a id="target-platforms" class="anchor" href="#target-platforms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Target Platforms</h1>

<p>MainMemory is intended to run on x86/x86-64 boxes with Linux or any BSD
flavor OS including Mac OS/X. The key requirement is the availability of
either epoll or kqueue API in addition to the standard POSIX API.</p>

<p>However so far it has only been extensively tested on Linux and Mac OS/X.
And on a single FreeBSD instance running on a VM. Therefore any portability
reports and/or patches are welcome.</p>

<p>MainMemory includes a not-much-tested "generic architecture" port so there
is a slim chance it will run on any non-x86 platform easily enough. But most
likely it will take some extra work. In the future it is planed to have a
native ARM port too.</p>

<h1>
<a id="build" class="anchor" href="#build" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build</h1>

<p>MainMemory relies on the venerable autotools suite to build. The build
procedure is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ./bootstrap
&gt; ./configure &lt;config-options&gt;
&gt; make
</code></pre>

<p>This produces few libraries and a binary file named 'mmem' located in the
'src' subdirectory. The 'mmem' file could be used as a replacement for your
memcached.</p>

<a id="single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-builds" class="anchor" href="#single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-builds" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single-Threaded and Multi-Threaded Builds</h2>

<p>MainMemory can be built in one of the two configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-threaded</li>
<li>or multi-threaded (SMP).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the former option, run the configure script as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ./configure
</code></pre>

<p>For the later option, run the configure script as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ./configure --enable-smp
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="what-build-to-use" class="anchor" href="#what-build-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Build to Use</h2>

<p>The single-threaded version does not use the synchronization mechanisms of
the multi-threaded version. Therefore it performs better (with higher
throughput and smaller latency) until it hits the single-core execution
limits.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb if the required throughput of the server is less than
about 100k requests per second then it might be beneficial to use the
single-threaded build. Otherwise the multi-threaded build is preferred.</p>
