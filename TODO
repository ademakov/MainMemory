ASAP:
* solve pool object reallocation problem
* crude memcache module
* add timers and task sleep
* correct shutdown:
** ensure worker & master & aux tasks are finished
** ensure socket & server object destruction
* correct destruction:
** ensure destroyed socket & server objects are not accessed anymore
** ensure task & port objects destruction issues (refcount? capabilities?)

Essentials:
* resolve socket close issues: time wait
* worker threads, multi-threaded task & work schedulers
* support signals
* UDP servers
* SSL servers
* fs notifications
* system call threads
* disk I/O threads
* configuration file parsing
* command line argument parsing
* syslog
* daemonize
* statistics
* performance instrumentation
* refined memcache module
* HTTP module

Enhancements:
* task fork/join
* task local storage (tls)
* reap dead tasks pending for too long
* memory management:
** use separate mspace for task local dynamic memory ?
** slab allocator (to base object pools on)
** buddy allocator (for I/O buffers and slabs)
** region allocator
** garbage collection
* failure trace records
* arm port
