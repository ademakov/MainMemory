ASAP:
* ensure correct client and server object destruction
* resolve socket close issues: time wait, event loop coordination
* add task cleanup handlers
* add task local storage (tls)
* take care of dead tasks
* add task cancel and kill
* add timers and task sleep
* resolve port destruction issues (refcount? capabilities?)
* support signals
* net I/O routines (read,write,readv,writev)
* better scheduler (with task priorities)
* x86 port

Essential:
* UDP servers
* SSL servers
* fs notifications
* memory management:
** region allocator
** add task local memory alloc & free
* configuration file parsing
* command line argument parsing
* worker threads
* system call threads
* disk I/O threads
* syslog
* daemonize
* statistics
* failure trace records
* performance instrumentation
* arm port

Enhancements:
* memory management:
** slab allocator (to base object pools on)
** buddy allocator (for I/O buffers and slabs)
** garbage collection

Sample modules:
* memcached
* HTTP
