ASAP:
* non-blocking log
* non-blocking pool
* non-blocking ring (for producers)
* improve smp performance
* implement memcache expiration
* thread-safe memcache CAS counter
* polish & optimize

;;; At this point it becomes usable in simple cases and ready for benchmarks
;;; against stock memcache.

Essentials:
* configuration file parsing
* command line argument parsing
* support signals
* system call threads
* resolve socket close issues: time wait
* disk I/O threads
* syslog
* daemonize
* statistics
* UDP servers
* SSL servers
* performance instrumentation
* refine memcache module:
** statistics
** add UDP protocol support
** add binary protocol support
* correct object destruction and graceful shutdown:
** ensure worker & master & aux tasks are finished on shutdown
** ensure destroyed socket & server objects are not accessed anymore
** ensure safe task & port objects destruction
** refcount? capabilities? some form of SMR?

Larger items:
* HTTP module
* persistence
* replication
* extension language

Enhancements:
* DNS resolver
* background workers
* proper future cancellation
** let tasks to be canceled across cores
** let catch task termination with setjmp/longjmp or libunwind mechanism
* fs event notification
* core and task local storage (tls)
* exit idle workers pending for too long
* reap dead tasks pending for too long
* shrink pools on low demand
* shrink memcache table on low demand
* improve ports:
** non-blocking
** allow sending other types
** function call marshal/dispatch mechanism on top of that
* try to detect clock adjustments and reset realtime timers accordingly
* memory management:
** use separate mspace for task local dynamic memory ?
** slab allocator (to base object pools on)
** buddy allocator (for I/O buffers and slabs)
** region allocator
** garbage collection
* failure trace records
* arm port
