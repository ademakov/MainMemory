ASAP:
* pool of worker tasks serving the work queue
* crude memcache module
* add timers and task sleep
* ensure correct client and server object destruction
** ensure destroyed client objects are not accessed anymore
* resolve port destruction issues (refcount? capabilities?)

Essentials:
* resolve socket close issues: time wait
* UDP servers
* SSL servers
* fs notifications
* support signals
* add task local storage (tls)
* add task cancel and kill
* worker threads, multithreaded task & work schedulers
* system call threads
* disk I/O threads
* syslog
* daemonize
* statistics
* performance instrumentation
* refined memcache module
* HTTP module

Enhancements:
* configuration file parsing
* command line argument parsing
* reap dead tasks pending for too long
* memory management:
** use separate mspace for task local dynamic memory ?
** slab allocator (to base object pools on)
** buddy allocator (for I/O buffers and slabs)
** region allocator
** garbage collection
* failure trace records
* arm port
