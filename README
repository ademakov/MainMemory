Main Memory
===========

Main Memory is a light-weight framework for networked servers of all sorts.
However efficient handling of in-memory workloads is its primary priority.
For instance, Main Memory could be used as a base for a memcached clone or
a caching HTTP server with superior performance and scalability.

The purpose of the Main Memory project is a bit akin to SGI's State Threads
Library (http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/). But Main Memory also aims
to take full advantage of modern multi-core systems with larger RAM sizes.
